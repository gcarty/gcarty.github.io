Description:
------------

	This site loads a google map with markers for places of interest. 
	This title for the markers are also displayed as a list to the left of the map.
	Clicking a Marker or an entry from the list does the following:
		* explands an infoWindow that pulls data and display 3 nearby venues from Foursquare.com
		* the map will pan to accommodate the selected marker
	The markers and list can be filtered by using the search bar. The filter function is *live*, i.e. (the page updates in realtime as the user type)
	There is an error routine that displays "Sorry! We are having temporary problems with our data feed" if there is a problem connecting with Foursqaure
	On small screens the menu becomes a horizontal list on an inverted color to draw attention to it and operates the same as on a larger screen
